"""SeeWhatISee.py — single backend script for all see-what-i-see skills.

All actions a skill can take collapse to flags on this one script:
  --stop                   Kill any existing watcher.
  --get-latest (default)   Emit the current last record from log.json.
  --all / --limit N        Emit records from the whole capture history.
  --watch                  Watch log.json and emit new records.

Multiple actions combine and run in that order.

History spans more than log.json: the extension keeps only the most
recent captures there and moves older ones into `history-*.json` files
beside it (see src/capture/log-store.ts). --all reads those history
files oldest-first and then log.json. --limit N instead walks from
log.json backwards through them and stops as soon as it has N records,
so it opens only the files it needs. Either way the emitted
stream is in capture order, oldest first. --search / --filter_site /
--filter_time narrow it. They narrow only the records listed from
history; records that arrive later under --watch are emitted
regardless.

A watcher also publishes its presence to the extension and can be
stopped from the Capture page; see docs/watch-protocol.md.
--no-lockfiles opts out, for running watchers in parallel.

Source-dir resolution (used for both reading log.json and writing the
pidfile) is the same regardless of action:
  --directory DIR         explicit override, used as-is.
  else .SeeWhatISee in .  parsed for `directory=...`.
  else $HOME/.SeeWhatISee same.
  else default            $HOME/Downloads/SeeWhatISee.
$SNAP_REAL_HOME is used instead of $HOME if set (snap installs of
Gemini CLI mangle $HOME).

Output: each emitted record is the log.json record re-serialized with
filenames rewritten to absolute paths pointing into the source dir
(or the --copy-to-dir directory). Records are emitted as JSONL, one per
line. --print_selection appends a `Selection:` block after the record it
belongs to.

With --copy-to-dir, the referenced files are first copied into that dir and the
rewritten paths point there instead of the source dir; this lets Gemini CLI
(which can only read its own workspace tmp dir) consume captures the extension
wrote into ~/Downloads/SeeWhatISee.

This script uses only the Python standard library, so installing a
skill bundle is just copying its files.

Wrappers under each skill customized for each AI tool just `exec` this
script with the right defaults.
See skills/*/skills/*/scripts/*.sh for the wrappers.

# the session will pass as --after (`resumeAfter`). The Capture page
# asks us to exit by dropping `watch-stop.json` beside it.
#
# `.watch.pid` is the original lock — one line, the pid — and is now
# **deprecated**, written only so older versions of this script can
# still find and replace us. Its format is frozen: old code parses the

# shuts down the same way it answers `watch-stop.json`: files released,
# a message saying which happened, EXIT_STOPPED.
#
# Both were picked because their *default* disposition is to terminate

USAGE = """\
Usage: SeeWhatISee.py [ACTIONS] [OPTIONS]

Actions (combinable; run in this order):
  --stop               Kill any existing watcher.
  --get-latest         Emit the current last record (default if no action
                       given). Cannot be combined with the history actions
                       below.
  --all                Emit every record in the capture history, oldest first.
  --limit N            Emit up to the N most recent records, oldest first.
  --watch              Watch log.json and emit new records as they arrive.

Options for the history listing:
  --search "words"     Show records where all words in the search string
                       appear in the url, title, or prompt (case-insensitive).
  --filter_site "str"  Show records whose http hosts contain this
                       substring (case-insensitive).
  --filter_time SPAN   Show records captured within SPAN (see below).

Filters without --all or --limit default to --limit 10.
Filters apply to history records but not to future records from --watch.

--filter_time spans:
  A span is one point, or a range of points written with `..`.
  Leaving an end off opens that end.
    2026-04-08               that day
    2026-04                  that month
    2026-04-08..2026-04-14   that date range, both ends included
    14:30..                  since 14:30 today
    ..2026-04-08 17          until the 17:00 hour that day
  A point is a date, a time, or both, or any partial prefix.
    2026-04-08 20:30:12.345  a full timestamp from the log
    2026-04-08 20            that full hour

    yesterday 14:30          that minute yesterday
    20260822-132959          the compact format used in capture filenames
  Times are local unless the value ends in `z`, which means UTC.
  Date and time may be separated with space or `t`.

General options:
  --directory DIR      Source dir to read log.json from. If unset, read
                       .SeeWhatISee config file (in . then $HOME) with a
                       `directory=...` line; otherwise defaults to
                       $HOME/Downloads/SeeWhatISee.
  --copy-to-dir DIR    Copy each emitted record's referenced files into DIR
                       before emitting, and rewrite paths to point under DIR.
                       By default, emitted paths point into the source dir.
  --print_selection    For records with a `selection` artifact, append its
                       file contents after the JSON line.
  --help               Show this help and exit.

Options for --watch:
  --no-lockfiles       Skip the files in $SOURCE_DIR that keep one watcher
                       running at a time and let other tools stop it
                       (.watch-status.json, .watch.pid, watch-stop.json).
                       Then multiple watchers can run in parallel.
  --loop               Keep polling after each emission; default is to exit
                       after the first.
  --after TIMESTAMP    Before polling, emit the record(s) that follow the last
                       record with TIMESTAMP in log.json. TIMESTAMP must match
                       an existing record's `timestamp` field exactly.
  --catch-up-one       Constrain --after to emit just a single record, not all
                       available records.
                       Mutually exclusive with --loop.
