# Emit exactly one new capture from the SeeWhatISee extension and

# record (with tmp-dir-absolute paths) to stdout.

# Used by the /see-what-i-see-watch Gemini command, which calls this
# once per iteration in a foreground loop. Gemini CLI has no async
# background worker with a completion callback, so the "watch" is
# just a series of blocking single-shot calls — one per iteration,
# with the agent passing --after between iterations to catch up on
# any captures that landed while it was processing the previous one.

Usage: watch-and-copy.sh [--after TIMESTAMP] [--help]

Emit exactly one new capture from log.json and exit. The record's
referenced files are copied into the Gemini tmp dir first, and the
JSON line is rewritten to absolute paths under that dir (matches
copy-last-snapshot.sh's output).

- Without --after: polls log.json's mtime every 0.5s and emits the
  new last record once the file changes from a non-empty baseline.
- With --after TIMESTAMP: if log.json already contains a record
  newer than the one whose `timestamp` matches TIMESTAMP, emits the
  next one immediately without polling. Use this between iterations
  of the watch loop so captures that arrived while the agent was
  processing the previous one aren't skipped. If TIMESTAMP is the
  newest record (or isn't in the log), falls back to the normal poll.

Options:
  --after TIMESTAMP  Catch up on any record newer than TIMESTAMP first.
  --help             Show this help and exit.
