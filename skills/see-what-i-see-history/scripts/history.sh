# The history skill passes --limit / --all / --search / --filter_site
# / --filter_time itself, so no action is forced here.
#
# Copying is opt-in for history, unlike the other Gemini wrappers,
# which always copy: a listing can cover many captures, and copying
# every file of every match before knowing which ones matter is a lot
# of wasted work. The skill lists first, then re-runs with --copy for
# the records it actually wants to read.
# See ../../see-what-i-see/scripts/copy-last-snapshot.sh for why
# copying is needed at all.
#
# SeeWhatISee.py lives in the see-what-i-see skill's scripts/ dir;
# reach across sibling-relative.

# The backend defaults to --get-latest when no action flag is given, so
# a history run that lost its flags would silently describe the newest
# capture instead. Fail loudly rather than answer a different question.
#
# --copy is matched only in flag position: a value-taking flag's
# argument (--search --copy) belongs to that flag, not to us.
# A --flag=value carries its own value, so it consumes no argument.
