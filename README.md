This GitHub project is the released version of the Gemini extension for SeeWhatISee.

## Gemini skills

- `/see-what-i-see` — read the latest snapshot and describe it
- `/see-what-i-see-watch` — watch for new snapshots to appear, and then look at them when they appear

If you've added a prompt with the snapshot, Gemini will follow it.

You can also add prompts after the commands above and they'll be applied
on each snapshot. For example,

- `/see-what-i-see` `What font is the heading on this page?`
- `/see-what-i-see-watch` `Just report the snapshot filenames`

## Installation

Install the Gemini extension:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/jshute96/SeeWhatISee-gemini
```

Add permissions in `$HOME/.gemini/settings.json` to avoid permission prompts:

```
{
  "tools": {
    "allowed": [
      "run_shell_command($HOME/.gemini/extensions/see-what-i-see/skills/see-what-i-see/scripts/copy-last-snapshot.sh)",
      "run_shell_command($HOME/.gemini/extensions/see-what-i-see/skills/see-what-i-see-watch/scripts/watch-and-copy.sh)"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Manual install

If `gemini extensions install` directly from GitHub doesn't work, clone the release repo and install the extension from files.

gemini extension install SeeWhatISee-gemini
```
